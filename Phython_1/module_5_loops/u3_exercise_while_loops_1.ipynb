    "Starting with the variables you've just created, create a while loop. The while loop will run while new_planet is not set to done. Inside the loop, check to see whether the new_planet variable contains a value, which should be the name of a planet. This is a quick way to see whether the user has entered a value. If they have, your code will append that value to the planets variable. Complete the while loop by using input to prompt the user to enter a new planet name or done if they're done entering planet names. You'll store the value from input in the new_planet variable. Finally, outside of the while loop, print the list of planets by using print. As you complete this part of the exercise, pay attention to tab levels to ensure code is run at the correct time."
